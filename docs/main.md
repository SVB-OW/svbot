# SVBot documentation

The SVBot is a discord bot for creating and managing ranked custom lobbies in Overwatch 2.
The documentation is split into 2 parts:

- The [user](user.md) documentation that shows how to use the bot in productive systems
- The [developer](dev.md) documentation showing how to create new commands for the bot
