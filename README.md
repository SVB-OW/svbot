- X assign rank roles on confirm
- X update command should update by discordId and log profile afterwards
- X remove memory db
- X announcement doesnt increase gamesPlayed
- X btagMessage in announcement can't be embed
- X check non found users
- X countdown/up update by id instead of tag
- check validations for ping, announce, clear
- rework matchmaker in announce?
